# The Dynasty

Hey there! We are Rohan, Sania, Rini, and Riya. So you must be wondering what this is, who we are and how extra it was to make a website. Well you are right, it is extra af, but this only took us a few minutes so we figured why not haha. Anyways, scroll through to learn more about us and find out why you should befriend our quirky bunch :)


## We put the ILY in FAMILY :purple_heart:
We are a fun wholesome bunch of people who love to meet new people, eat amazing food, all things Harry Potter, watch Desi movies, listen to all types of music, and _**DANCE**_!

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RohanB13/sasa-bl/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RohanB13/sasa-bl/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
